# KeyTone

## Introduction

KeyTone is a practical software that can simulate the sound of keystrokes in real-time in environments where silence is required, thereby enhancing your comfort when using a computer.

Although there are already many similar software on the market, KeyTone is still committed to providing users with the best experience.

KeyTone's **core is implemented in high-performance Go**, which lays a solid foundation for the application's performance and allows for greater optimization potential.
> At this stage, our hybrid architecture uses Electron as the UI layer because it enables **rapid and stable implementation of complex cross-platform features**. Although Electron applications tend to be large in size, this is **not a long-term bottleneck for the KeyTone project architecture**. From the early stages of the project, we have included the evaluation and integration of lighter Go desktop frameworks (such as Wails) in our technical roadmap, and **will smoothly migrate or refactor when their ecosystems are mature enough to completely solve the size issue.**

In addition, KeyTone is an open-source software that follows the GPL license.

## Features

* Simple functionality, ready to use out of the box.
* Key press and release can be independently bound to sound effects.
* Designed based on real key trigger conditions, sound effects are only played at the moment of pressing and releasing, and will not be repeated while holding down.
* Highly customizable, users can quickly customize the sound of keys according to their own needs. This software has designed and developed a rich and convenient series of functions around key sound albums.
* Provides rich [documentation support](https://keytone.xuanhall.com/zh/guide/getting-started/quick-start/) to help users quickly understand the software's features as much as possible.

## Highlights

Unleash your creativity with keystroke sounds to craft a unique and personalized auditory experience.

KeyTone does not provide any audio filesâ€”this is by design!
> We encourage you to tap into your creativity by uploading your own or collected audio to create your personalized keystroke sound collection.

With KeyTone, you can:
* Combine multiple sounds into a single ***advanced sound*** and bind it to a single key, setting these sounds to play randomly or in sequence each time the key is pressed (playing one sound at a time).
* Allow these ***advanced sounds*** to be combined, inherited, and nested with each other, helping you create rich, varied sound effects and unlocking endless possibilities for keystroke sounds.
* **Participate in the production and sharing of Keytone albums. The main sharing community is the [Keytone community on itch](https://lusrackhall.itch.io/keytone/community). Welcome to contribute topics or join discussions on existing topics!**
* Of course, as a prerequisite, the sound files (or audio files) are not provided in this project and will not be provided in the future.
