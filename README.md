# KeyTone

## Introduction

KeyTone is a practical software that can simulate the sound of keystrokes in real-time in environments where silence is required, thereby enhancing your comfort when using a computer.

Although there are already many similar software on the market, KeyTone is still committed to providing users with the best experience.

In addition, KeyTone is an open-source software that follows the GPL license.

## Features

* Simple functionality, ready to use out of the box.
* Key press and release can be independently bound to sound effects.
* Designed based on real key trigger conditions, sound effects are only played at the moment of pressing and releasing, and will not be repeated while holding down.
* Highly customizable, users can quickly customize the sound of keys according to their own needs. This software has designed and developed a rich and convenient series of functions around key sound albums.
