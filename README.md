# KeyTone

## Introduction

KeyTone is a practical software that can simulate the sound of keystrokes in real-time in environments where silence is required, thereby enhancing your comfort when using a computer.

Although there are already many similar software on the market, KeyTone is still committed to providing users with the best experience.

In addition, KeyTone is an open-source software that follows the GPL license.

## Features

* Simple functionality, ready to use out of the box.
* Key press and release can be independently bound to sound effects.
* Designed based on real key trigger conditions, sound effects are only played at the moment of pressing and releasing, and will not be repeated while holding down.
* Highly customizable, users can quickly customize the sound of keys according to their own needs. This software has designed and developed a rich and convenient series of functions around key sound albums.
* Provides rich [documentation support](https://keytone.xuanhall.com/zh/guide/getting-started/quick-start/) to help users quickly understand the software's features as much as possible.

## Highlights

Unleash your creativity with keystroke sounds to craft a unique and personalized auditory experience.

KeyTone does not provide any audio filesâ€”this is by design!
> We encourage you to tap into your creativity by uploading your own or collected audio to create your personalized keystroke sound collection.

With KeyTone, you can:
* Combine multiple sounds into a single ***advanced sound*** and bind it to a single key, setting these sounds to play randomly or in sequence each time the key is pressed (playing one sound at a time).
* Allow these ***advanced sounds*** to be combined, inherited, and nested with each other, helping you create rich, varied sound effects and unlocking endless possibilities for keystroke sounds.

* Of course, as a prerequisite, the sound files (or audio files) are not provided in this project and will not be provided in the future.

KeyTone offers you a stage for free creation, turning every keystroke into a unique piece of sound art.
