# Introduction

Welcome to the usage guide for the KeyTone key sound album creation page! Here, you can unleash your creativity and craft a personalized key sound experience. Whether you want to emulate the crisp sound of a vintage typewriter or have each keystroke accompanied by a unique note, the key sound album feature can meet your needs.

## **Core Process Overview**

Creating a complete key sound album typically involves the following four core steps:

* **Load Audio Files (Step 1)**: This is the starting point of all creations. You need to load your audio materials into KeyTone, which will serve as the foundation for subsequent sound definitions and bindings.
* **Define and Trim Sounds (Step 2)**: If you’ve loaded a longer audio file or want to extract multiple distinct sound segments from a single file, this step will help you precisely trim and define them.
* **Craft Premium Key Sounds (Step 3)**: Looking for a more advanced experience? In this step, you can combine multiple sounds into a premium key sound with specific playback logic (e.g., independent, random, or sequential playback). Within a single premium key sound, you can define sounds for both the key press and release actions.
* **Link Sounds to Key Actions (Step 4)**: The final step is to bind your carefully prepared audio source files, defined sounds, or premium key sounds to specific key actions, creating your own immersive experience.

To prevent the insertion of malicious programs during key sound album sharing, KeyTone has developed and adopted the `.ktalbum` file format. This format includes encryption and verification mechanisms to ensure, to a certain extent, the integrity and security of key sound albums.

In the following documentation, we will provide detailed explanations of the operations and concepts for each step. The documentation will often use the format **(Step n)** to assist in explaining the relationships between steps, helping you better understand and use the system.
