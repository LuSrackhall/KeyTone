# Privacy Policy

## Introduction

Thank you for using the KeyTone application (hereinafter referred to as "this application"). We highly value user privacy and data protection. This privacy policy will detail how we collect, use, and protect your information.

## Information Collection and Use

This application may collect the following information during its operation:
- **Keystroke Status**: This application needs to globally monitor the press and release status of keys in order to provide users with the keystroke sound function. This information is only used to play the corresponding keystroke sound and will not be stored or transmitted.
- **Device Information**: We may collect anonymous information about your device to improve our services. This information includes, but is not limited to, device model, operating system version, and application usage.

## Permission Description

Due to the special nature of Win32 applications packaged as appx, the `runFullTrust` permission (which includes the global keystroke monitoring permission, sound playback permission, etc., required by this application) is necessary. This permission allows this application to obtain the necessary system resources to ensure the normal operation of the keystroke sound function.

## Information Protection

We are committed to taking appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. All collected information is processed locally and will not be shared with any third party.

## Privacy Policy Updates

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any updates will be posted on this page, please check it regularly for the latest information.
