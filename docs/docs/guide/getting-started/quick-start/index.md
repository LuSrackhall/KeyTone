# Quick Start

This guide will help you quickly master KeyTone's basic operations and core features.

## Launching and Quitting

* After installation (see [Installation](../installation/index.md)), KeyTone will reside in both the taskbar and system tray.
* On the main interface, select your preferred keytone album (requires users to create or import their own) and adjust the volume for optimal typing feedback.
* Closing the window won't terminate the app. To fully quit, use the tray icon's context menu (right-click the tray icon).

## Core Configuration

### Volume Control

* Use the main interface's volume slider for real-time adjustments. The mute button (left of the slider) toggles global silence (synchronized with tray menu options).
* You can further adjust the slider's maximum attenuation range of the main page slider in the settings page for finer volume control and lower volume levels.
* The settings page also provides an additional volume control slider, allowing the volume to exceed 100% (use cautiously to prevent audio clipping).

### Other Settings

* Set the software language.
* Configure whether to hide the window on startup.
* Enable or disable auto-start on boot (subject to the operating systemâ€™s auto-start settings and restrictions).

## Next Steps

* Explore the [Key Sound Album Guide](../../key-package/introduction/index.md) to learn more about sound customization options.

Enjoy your enhanced typing experience!
