# `0.3.4` *(2025-01)*

### Bug Fixes

* **ui | electron | appx:** Changed the icon background back to white for Windows Store and desktop shortcuts. ([0bfb32e](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/commit/0bfb32ebb727785b26bf3b5c74b0cb46632a091c)), closes [#57](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/issues/57)
* **ui | electron:** Fixed an issue where internal URL routes in the application would trigger new Electron windows when clicked with `ctrl+left mouse button`. (By monitoring new window creation events under mainWindow and validating if the creation behavior is expected before it occurs) ([aad9f3d](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/commit/aad9f3d1482e490f5206545b13941df2b6e5da0e)), closes [#40](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/issues/40)
* **ui | electron:** Temporarily removed auto-start settings in appx format from the settings page due to unresolved auto-start functionality issues. (Only removed for appx package format) ([8bed9d4](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/commit/8bed9d4dc8e5a98b8c96299ce27934dadfc7f291)), closes [#58](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/issues/58)
