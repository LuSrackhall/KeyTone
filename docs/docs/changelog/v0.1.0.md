# `0.1.0` *(2024-06-20)*
 
### Bug Fixes

* **frontend | electron:** Successfully fixed the issue of shadow not showing, and incidentally solved the problem of the right side corner seeming incomplete. < Adopted solution two, single transparent native window + pure css solution> ([4694a61](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/commit/4694a613f61f81b417562a3b806e05a7b44aa5b4))
* **frontend | electron:** Failed to fix the issue of shadow not showing. The reason for this failure is due to a shallow understanding of the electron window mechanism < solution one cannot be implemented>. And not deep enough understanding of css < solution two cannot be implemented>. ([d40fb49](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/commit/d40fb499c45c47a752313f5d5fa7b59bc581b53d))
* **frontend:** Successfully fixed the issue of the lower left corner being covered by a right angle after expanding the drawer. < However, during the opening process, there will still be a brief right angle residue, but this problem is not big and is considered to be a problem with the quasar framework itself, so it will not be solved for the time being> ([91f2f9f](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/commit/91f2f9fe17b4eb87193e487693c5fc8811755d0f))


### Features

* **frontend | electron:** Attempted to add frosted glass effect through electron transparent window + css failed < because the frosted glass of this scheme cannot directly penetrate to the operating system desktop>. Therefore, this time only the main interface background is changed to gradient color. ([3b58b4f](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/commit/3b58b4f0ca77d00d67e4374aa22dbe321b6311e8))
* **frontend | electron:** Initialized the entry file of electron, configured the related items of electron in the quasar configuration file, this time mainly for win related configuration. ([50f22db](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/commit/50f22db02d61ff68728fd9416212ba83ba4e03b3))
* **frontend | electron:** Implemented the tray icon background function, and initialized the tray menu. So far, closing the window normally no longer exits the application, but continues to run in the tray background. ([a547184](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/commit/a547184df52a0ff7caf2beecad28483807b2623a))
* **frontend | electron:** Use the main interface logo as the temporary logo of the application ([069689f](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/commit/069689f9baf49a7296769b0292d6f672d1925881))
* **frontend | electron:** Added window rounding, but due to the content being full < it has been confirmed that this is the reason>, the shadow cannot be displayed normally. And the right corner seems incomplete. ([467ce32](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/commit/467ce329a44a5f587a3d7f580cd3fdfc41af98df))
* **frontend | electron:** Added producer display, and called the native api through the electron preload script to open the system default browser to display the producer's github homepage. ([d126b71](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/commit/d126b712193a331c83bcfa3110687f34ea5a8143))
* **frontend:** Added version number display after the application name ([843aea4](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/commit/843aea47c91b804a0fd64539adc8a547bbb314c4))
* **frontend:** The main interface only needs to be filled with icons for the time being, the initial shell version does not require any extra features. ([1aa79f5](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/commit/1aa79f51f2c519e84f27aa9b7eef22a5180816f1))
* **mvp:** 1.Implemented the global listening function of the keyboard. 2.Implemented the audio playback function. 3.Implemented the core function logic of mvp keyboard sound.
