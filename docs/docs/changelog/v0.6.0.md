* **sdk | log:** Optimized log storage logic by adding a file size-based log rotation mechanism and a log retention days-based historical log cleanup logic to prevent log files from becoming too large and invalid log files from affecting storage space. ([a46a108](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/commit/a46a108880f34d3d1763c2285376d6327f4faeb1)), closes [#86](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/issues/86)

* **sdk:** Fixed a bug on Windows where, when using the import album button (in overwrite import mode), audio source files were occupied by audio streams, preventing the deletion/replacement of existing key sound albums (mainly because internal audio source files could not be processed).

* **sdk:** Fixed a bug on Windows where, when using the delete key sound album button, audio source files were occupied by audio streams, preventing the deletion of existing key sound albums (mainly because internal audio source files could not be processed). Additionally, this fix enhanced the reliability of the function to close all currently managed audio streams. ([addd713](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/commit/addd713940978440938c77d9c046ee00018b6ffc)), closes [#88](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/issues/88) [#93](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/issues/93)
