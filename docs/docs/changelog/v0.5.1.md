# `0.5.1` *(2025-06-05)*

### Bug Fixes

* Fixed abnormal button style when there is no album on the Key Sound Album page, which was caused by i18n language changes. ([0d5e68c](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/commit/0d5e68c08884d29fe6cb424b34cacd867a65a5a4))
* Fixed the issue where the prompt text for importing or creating an album on the main page would wrap unattractively when the i18n text was too long. A scrollbar is now introduced. ([dd3ddb8](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/commit/dd3ddb853008fc862cb1361c521f939fe941b368))
* **appx:** Fixed the issue where the appx package did not support all actually supported languages except Chinese and English. ([f598c5d](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/commit/f598c5d72b154aef5eb071dbd97acf595c90ab85))
* **appx:** Fixed the bug where the text in the startup and auto-startup settings in the settings page would overflow after packaging as appx, especially when switching between different i18n languages.
