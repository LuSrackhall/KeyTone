# `0.2.0` *(2024-08)*

### Bug Fixes

* Improved the real-time feedback to the UI when changes are detected in the configuration file. <Adjusted the debounce delay in milliseconds (reduced)> ([941e175](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/commit/941e175c84bda2012f336b390817ea19452c635a))
* Fixed the bug where the volume increase/decrease slider would behave abnormally when set to less than -5 or -g. <Even setting it to less than 0 could cause the slider range to shrink due to the design issue of the main page's min volume> ([1a0a88f](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/commit/1a0a88f96e19993256dbc1b75a0b19e0bd8c9bdb)), closes [#15](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/issues/15)
* **frontend | electron:** Fixed the bug where the window would not pop up when reopening a singleton in the tray background <i.e., hidden window situation>. ([1657cb9](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/commit/1657cb99317e8a87c20890988c6fbff0ca8cabf7))
* **frontend | ui:** Fixed the bug where the page could be selected. <This is because I want the interface of this tool application to be more like an interface rather than a page, so I disabled text selection and image dragging on the page.> ([09e688a](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/commit/09e688a0be5a2116e59bc6946874851e5f49ed0e))
* **mute:** For the mute button on the main page, it was too easy to accidentally reactivate it with the keyboard. <Causing a bad experience, mistakenly thinking it couldn't be muted, so I disabled the keyboard event trigger mechanism in the click event, only retaining the mouse click event.> ([82103c0](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/commit/82103c0f5b2998915f9f6a4f54bab7725b445e00))
* **sdk:** Continued to fix the rare crash bug of the SDK. <Although the documentation says that viper is not safe for concurrent read and write, I tested it briefly, and pure concurrent reads rarely crash, but concurrent reads and writes or pure concurrent writes are prone to crashes, so I switched to read-write locks.> ([ecda87c](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/commit/ecda87c698bffe907cb7aaa0eb5b238a3e8d1144))
* **sdk:** Solved the high-priority override issue of viper.Set(), making its usage more suitable for the application's scenario. <Although I don't know if this will increase the overhead, the performance bottleneck in a pure client application is almost negligible> ([f97fac5](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/commit/f97fac592066718973ccc72996422bb7f633441f)), closes [#18](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/issues/18) [#11](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/issues/11)
* **sdk:** Fixed the rare crash bug of the SDK. <Although the probability is very small, viper is not safe for concurrent read and write, so I temporarily added a mutex lock to align the set and get behaviors.> ([1c884a6](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/commit/1c884a6cb2ded11d544c7f6bbf0ec5400a7288ed))
* **tray:** Changed the tray's 'close' option name to 'quit'. ([adc9439](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/commit/adc9439c4de7e7c73ebfa0569578de37ca2cfefa))
* **UI interaction changes:** For the settings interface, changed the default state of each group of configurations from expanded to collapsed. ([42c84e4](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/commit/42c84e4b0c492cc6c027134afd9bc29b576782c6)), closes [#13](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/issues/13)
* **UI:** Fixed the overflow issue, now the potentially overflowing content and scroll bars will no longer overflow the interface. ([d060ad6](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/commit/d060ad67e6415a8adc09d93b1ee3e75a9c2af33a)), closes [#12](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/issues/12)


### Features

* Enhanced the functionality of the navigation bar, allowing the application name to be clicked to go directly to the main page; added a button to close the side navigation in the side navigation; optimized the closing logic of the side navigation, allowing it to be closed even when an option is clicked but no routing occurs. ([2215d01](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/commit/2215d018d6c7e96f03170d1b5fcb182b1b3161dc))
* Added volume adjustment slider and mute icon to the main page. That is, added volume adjustment and mute functions to the main page. ([537f349](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/commit/537f34949093490586b86578fee3fe36fbbcaab0)), closes [#15](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/issues/15)
* **Main page configuration items:** Added input box for volume reduction range on the main page; switch for enabling the volume debugging slider on the main page; default hidden volume debugging slider on the main page; related i18n items. ([1c29d04](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/commit/1c29d046129896b878c8109c639714a30c4c427a)), closes [#17](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/issues/17)
* **fix:** Improved the functionality of international multi-language settings. <This submission is a small stage summary submission--too lazy to handle this part with a PR: In the previous small submission, we initialized the settings page and added simple page navigation functions in the UI.> ([5b3eaa7](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/commit/5b3eaa7d506841ae69e099ac2d1d67c54e2474b8))
* **sse:** Introduced SSE, and through SSE and viper's file monitoring callback, synchronized real-time configuration changes of the configuration file to the front-end UI. <For example, the mute setting completed on the electron side, or the mute setting completed by manually modifying the configuration file.> ([62bc498](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/commit/62bc4989264cacd4c5175c21539e4340edb1592f)), closes [#19](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/issues/19) [#11](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/issues/11) [#18](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/issues/18)
* **tray:** Introduced mute/unmute options in the system tray. ([a55a20e](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/commit/a55a20eb7c49205e7b14c684d2729ab808131565)), closes [#18](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/issues/18)
* **UI interaction changes:** Added passive functionality to manage the expanded or collapsed state of each group of configurations on the settings page during runtime. ([26303d6](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/commit/26303d63a453dbf81ac647f15e38a36471a69d08)), closes [#13](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/issues/13)
* **UI:** Implemented the functionality to increase/decrease the volume of the original audio package on the settings interface, and related internationalization content configuration; introduced lodash debounce; in addition, perfectly solved some known bugs that might exist in this function. ([73d1605](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/commit/73d1605de48a57657f3e0690ce44354f80bf981f)), closes [#6](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/issues/6) [#14](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/issues/14)
* **UI:** Added a series of settings for "startup and auto-start" on the UI settings page ([c05c646](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/commit/c05c6465553fe07e480a77771ec0b11c14744eaa)), closes [#4](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/issues/4) [#5](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/issues/5)
