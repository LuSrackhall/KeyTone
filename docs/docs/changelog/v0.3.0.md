# `0.3.0` *(2025-01)*

### Bug Fixes

* Fixed issue where global key sound settings couldn't set empty values for key press/release sounds, preventing users from defining press-only or release-only sounds, or removing all definitions. Solution: Use empty string. ([a9d56b8](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/commit/a9d56b80b17bf8e6e0d442dc4d5ab2b736bec4ca)), closes [#45](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/issues/45)
* Fixed bug where notifications for multiple key presses during single key DIK code and name real-time mapping were incorrectly triggered when the application lost focus. ([1c51e42](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/commit/1c51e4271c1e781ed1cb8c62b08d70ed94d3c941)), closes [#47](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/issues/47)
* **sdk:** When a sound in the audio package is deleted, it should not panic during playback, but only log the corresponding error event. ([36502ba](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/commit/36502ba55f83fd69617f98ef52b6fb43cc97ab0d)), closes [#52](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/issues/52)
* **sdk:** When a source file in the audio package is deleted, it should not panic during playback, but only log the corresponding event. (Further handling needed, such as notifying frontend or continuing to check next priority sound effects until embedded test sound playback) ([0caa183](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/commit/0caa183ca6bfc06d6b75cae7a79c241c6df00b72)), closes [#51](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/issues/51)
* **sdk:** Addressed memory leak issues - partly caused by too many goroutines (can be solved with goroutine pool), another larger leak possibly related to beep. Quick memory cleanup causes sounds to not properly finish playing, leading to bigger memory leaks. Manual termination causes undesirable interruption of sounds that should play. ([cefcbae](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/commit/cefcbae0a25f66454242c3ead34045856c797656))
* **sdk:** Fixed issue where sha256 field and actual audio source file weren't deleted when removing source file if no name existed under that sha256. Currently has minor issue with real source file path name, couldn't get audioPkgUUID. ([efd4d64](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/commit/efd4d645d949e8012d9efa8363a74417bd66d127)), closes [#29](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/issues/29)
* **sdk:** Completely resolved file deletion functionality by adding missing parameter information, fixing inability to delete actual files and corresponding sha256 config fields. ([6b81822](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/commit/6b8182275b7d6d530371e5d600beace1bbab84cf)), closes [#29](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/issues/29)
* **sdk:** New beep version partially fixes memory leak issues. Upgraded beep dependency version and working on resolving related issues in this project. ([ed5c59e](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/commit/ed5c59e14352f01ab9b31149be2b198a67ea97b5))
* **sdk:** Fixed memory leak issues! ([4df2433](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/commit/4df2433bba9262c820f5bc65c031b209ef6ae8d9))
* **sdk:** Fixed bug preventing correct configuration manipulation during first startup [specifically startup without config file]. Also fixed potential bug that could cause deletion of other same-level config items when manipulating config items [specifically same-level items assigned nil]. ([3f541c7](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/commit/3f541c755e90ce81a9b8250115996010e1b308c9))
* **sdk:** Fixed SDK panic crash caused by empty values in premium keysounds when type is 'random' or 'loop' being selected as corresponding key linkage sound effects. ([f36cb52](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/commit/f36cb52c95777d662333455fc91ff4dfe6131bda)), closes [#44](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/issues/44) [#45](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/issues/45)
* **sdk:** Fixed bug causing firewall to constantly warn about KeyTone listening on certain ports. ([dbe52ec](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/commit/dbe52ec9723d388f408bf62ed0d5fbc2e6712f57)), closes [#34](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/issues/34)
* **sdk:** Fixed incorrect usage of beep, following expected rule of calling speaker.Init() only once in entire lifecycle. Prevents potential memory leaks and keeps fragmented memory buffers within acceptable range. ([95a9671](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/commit/95a96719ac3f02eb6e3d03a65c81b2c9548f6d93))
* **ui | sdk:** Re-evaluated the option to enable embedded test sounds during key linkage sound steps. Shouldn't just provide a single enable/disable option for embedded test sounds, but should separate it into enable/disable options for press/release embedded test sounds. ([6f77c72](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/commit/6f77c72c5c7af3a00149b6f23664f5dab25449d9)), closes [#43](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/issues/43)
* **ui:** 30ms debounce delay wasn't working in the key sound package name input box on the key sound package interface [main settings work fine]. Added debounce delay specifically for the name input box. Note [in Vue, defining functions or constants in lifecycle hook callbacks like onBeforeMount is usually fine if the hook is triggered alone, but it's better to define them outside]. ([21fc36d](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/commit/21fc36da680ed054e72bad5e394cd34f1a47ec95))
* **ui:** In the code for editing existing sounds, the type definition names of related models were inappropriate, and some fields were missing. -- The source was the related code for sound production missing the related volume field in error configuration. ([ab4fdc0](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/commit/ab4fdc0e2fdc27d42e16ff07add802cf61a5ef2b)), closes [#31](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/issues/31) [#33](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/issues/33)
* **ui:** Completely fixed the bug in the press/release configuration of the new key sound dialog mentioned in recent submissions -> the so-called bug caused by object reference changes. ([e6aa9d7](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/commit/e6aa9d7f8b38a266b39291a55115136b44b738af)), closes [#36](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/issues/36) [#41](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/issues/41)
* **ui:** Fixed the bug where even if only one key was actually pressed, the 'multiple keys pressed simultaneously' message kept popping up after certain special scenarios (e.g., win+j win+k or left-click selection box followed by esc key). ([09db473](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/commit/09db4732062a277b2448b0202798c6c996e2fff0)), closes [#44](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/issues/44) [#47](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/issues/47)
* **ui:** Adapted responsive labels as much as possible for the selection input boxes in the press and release configurations of the new key sound dialog. However, there are still some issues -> after changing the sound name, 1. object reference changes; 2. reactivity is not triggered, mainly when the sound name changes from an empty string to a non-empty string. ([7745e0a](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/commit/7745e0afa159901808d1246e544923b95f12b122)), closes [#36](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/issues/36) [#41](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/issues/41)
* **ui:** Corresponding to StoreSet logic, although it's rarely concerned whether the transmission is successful, it can be omitted but not absent. Therefore, return a boolean flag indicating success or failure. ([9232941](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/commit/9232941fe1cb3fba10426116cb32d37fddd89955))
* **ui:** Changed the incorrect code structure before changing the logic of single key recording. Modified to the correct structure, i.e., the related logic's API should be separated into two independent groups: recording-related and recording-related. ([5ddb7e6](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/commit/5ddb7e61c0816db124789ce1172bf70b095455ce)), closes [#47](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/issues/47) [#50](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/issues/50)
* **ui:** Abandoned using the entire object as the UUID for the selection input box component, instead using a self-specified UUID. Completely avoided the bug caused by object reference changes solved in recent submissions -> the so-called bug caused by object reference changes, allowing for type structure changes at will, as it's just for convenience in JS/TS. ([4d5a336](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/commit/4d5a336f18d325a0d7a590dbcfb4cc048405cf47)), closes [#33](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/issues/33) [#41](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/issues/41)
* **ui:** In the single key sound definition, modified the logic for identifying keys with single key sounds to only consider keys with at least one of down/up correctly set and value not empty string as keys with single key sounds. ([8d4c9b6](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/commit/8d4c9b6721e9ad5f51085ba33b4b07405e3fc433)), closes [#44](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/issues/44)
* **ui:** In the single key sound definition, fixed the conversion handling method when initializing the original data of the sound effect of the clicked single key, encountering a value that exists but is an empty string. Changed from returning itself to returning null. ([b64511d](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/commit/b64511d54209824fcff97b4f4de444577932756a)), closes [#44](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/issues/44)
* **ui:** Placed the corresponding logic where it should be, making the code logic clearer. 1. Moved the logic for loading persistent key sound packages at startup to App.vue or boot; 2. After selecting a key sound package, load calls in both watch and SSE callbacks, double insurance. ([df8cd2f](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/commit/df8cd2fece23ea2274b79721b9eb7dfb1945aeba)), closes [#54](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/issues/54)
* **ui:** Fixed the bug where the list wouldn't automatically close after each selection when selecting multiple sounds in the new key sound dialog. ([9fbddac](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/commit/9fbddac3fd4da0ef792bba5959a84ac4fbf06665)), closes [#36](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/issues/36)
* **ui:** Adapted the business logic in the edit existing sound dialog under the new architecture, current adaptation progress -> 1. Solved potential reference change issues using bound UUID; 2. Solved error issues caused by type mismatch when displaying labels. ([8662828](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/commit/8662828fdae65c017aec15f7ca24d1763c77d947)), closes [#37](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/issues/37)
* **ui:** Adapted the business logic in the edit existing sound dialog under the new architecture, current adaptation progress -> completed -> solved the final remaining issue of abnormal label display in the list [originally caused by inconsistent element types between list items and selected items]. ([f1e937d](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/commit/f1e937de63ffcc8d15db1894658f5d033785e3dd)), closes [#37](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/issues/37) [#42](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/issues/42) [#39](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/issues/39)
* **ui:** Improved the validation logic and notification bar information when adding new sounds to the configuration file. ([7830f49](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/commit/7830f4996cd1d94f92691043d5a040e416458480)), closes [#31](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/issues/31)
* **ui:** Fixed the issue of abnormal judgment of whether there is a key sound before editing an existing key sound. ([34f6bca](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/commit/34f6bca3c2cf6cad891d2d880f13f87641c638b8)), closes [#37](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/issues/37)
* **ui:** Fixed the bug where reverse positioning was not possible when selecting the type as a source file when creating a new key sound under the new architecture. The reason was the omission of key fields during storage, which has been fixed in this submission. ([b4e407d](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/commit/b4e407df354c28ca215d820b36942dba5fe4a34b)), closes [#39](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/issues/39) [#36](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/issues/36)
* **ui:** Fixed the issue where the user's selected persistent key sound package couldn't be reloaded after exiting the key sound package creation interface. Now, the corresponding logic will be executed in the lifecycle hook when exiting this interface. ([19b601b](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/commit/19b601b9818eea4ce5b100c6bdf7cf409470c0c2)), closes [#54](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/issues/54)
* **ui:** Fixed the inaccurate notification banner prompt when saving configurations in the new key sound and edit existing key sound dialogs. After the fix, if it's a creation, it will be a creation success, and if it's an edit, it will be a modification success. ([e18c569](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/commit/e18c5695c772800970c29a40858b08c953441a3f)), closes [#36](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/issues/36) [#37](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/issues/37)
* **ui:** Fixed a bug in the edit existing sound dialog -> object reference change. Also fixed two bugs in the press/release configuration dialog of the new key sound dialog -> 1. object reference change; 2. reactivity not triggered [mainly when the sound name changes from an empty string to a non-empty string]. ([203b4a1](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/commit/203b4a18827b34c7167934fe234966c834caafad)), closes [#33](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/issues/33) [#36](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/issues/36) [#41](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/issues/41)
* **ui:** Fixed a bug where certain keys with specific functions would affect recording behavior during single key recording. ([2f9306e](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/commit/2f9306ea9f2fb2a5948235928211ec214a19ce4a)), closes [#50](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/issues/50)
* **ui:** Fixed the circular dependency bug between the embedded test sound enable component and SSE during the key linkage sound step. Also, modified some prompt box content and button positions in the UI. ([c2b97c8](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/commit/c2b97c8f26d04cad73e44f82e1d45b4c834df248)), closes [#43](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/issues/43)
* **ui:** Fixed the bug where the 'enter' key on the numeric keypad would cause a message of multiple keys pressed simultaneously to be reported again when any key was pressed during single key recording. ([ceb5dd4](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/commit/ceb5dd4e2fe01df4d565949b8f0f9eb8dae6fcd1)), closes [#50](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/issues/50)
* **ui:** Fixed the bug where non-premium key sounds were also accidentally anchored when anchoring to premium key sounds in the global key sound settings dialog. After this fix, selecting or completely deleting will only have an anchoring effect on premium key sounds, and non-premium key sounds will be completely unaffected by the anchoring effect. ([c3dae27](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/commit/c3dae27808ed4533dd22648eb19cd17f1b50330d)), closes [#45](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/issues/45)
* **ui:** Fixed the bug where the event of freely expanding/collapsing each step in the global stepper would also trigger in the content area after the step was expanded. In this submission, a directive converter was introduced for unocss to be compatible with the [@apply](https://github.com/apply) directive syntax in tailwindcss. ([dbdc024](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/commit/dbdc024973efcecc392b9fe7470725399052f908)), closes [#21](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/issues/21)
* **ui:** Fixed the issue where the SDK would return an error parameter to the frontend due to the SoundFileRename call triggered by actively assigning an empty value to selectedSoundFile.value after successfully deleting a file. ([35b8dfd](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/commit/35b8dfdf752733344bc4787f42f1288005e3a521)), closes [#29](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/issues/29)
* **ui:** Fixed the bug where the error prompt in the input box on the key sound package creation interface wouldn't respond to the switch between Chinese and English. This bug may not be a real user requirement that can be accessed in this application, but it is indeed a bug. ([780877f](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/commit/780877f37621a8f26ed1ac8626015198e2890d3e)), closes [#28](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/issues/28)
* **ui:** Fixed the issue where the anchoring logic was invalid in the components related to the press and release sound settings in the single key sound definition. The problem was caused by missing adaptive changes in this part when solving the global sound selection code. ([5238682](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/commit/523868272cad3264106de22f0126927384e7e8b5)), closes [#44](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/issues/44)
* **ui:** Fixed the bug where the file option still existed in the UI after deleting the last sound source file. -- This is a purely frontend issue because the SDK has already deleted the audio source file and correctly updated the configuration file. ([26166f7](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/commit/26166f757ac1b165a4fb26b00fd36b326894cc53)), closes [#29](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/issues/29)
* **ui:** Fixed some previously undiscovered logical issues in the code ([18a23d5](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/commit/18a23d5b0fba36e7c73780b80cbff4a096e5e943)), closes [#29](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/issues/29)
* **ui:** Fixed the bug where the logic couldn't be executed correctly after the SSE callback due to the missing configuration name caused by deleting a source file, which in turn affected the data structure driving the UI. ([9e8f2d6](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/commit/9e8f2d62000c37ccae70a12ff6a55e9393f60175)), closes [#29](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/issues/29)
* **ui:** Fixed the issue where the user's selected persistent audio package wasn't correctly loaded into the SDK after restarting or returning from the create/edit key sound package interface, as well as potential duplicate loading issues. ([fdf4c48](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/commit/fdf4c48e4b237bd406c2ca12ef83b6d70da3013d)), closes [#54](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/issues/54)
* **ui:** Fixed the second issue in the previous submission, which wasn't caused by the failure to assign an extra name field. The real reason was the assignment error caused by the mismatch between the name_id of the sound object and the nameID of the sound file object, resulting in undefined. ([caf9df0](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/commit/caf9df0b6bd821562ecef6a0ee4fd790b9c85583)), closes [#33](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/issues/33)
* **ui:** Fixed the first issue in the submission before the last one. Solution - changed the way of obtaining the name from direct acquisition to finding itself through the array's find method and sha256+name_id fields to reacquire the name. ([41a5631](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/commit/41a5631c022091807087a84bbab89ac1191fb9de)), closes [#33](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/issues/33)
* **ui:** Fixed the bug where the corresponding sound source file couldn't be recognized for editing due to an empty name when editing the audio source file name. ([0046e7d](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/commit/0046e7d6976c94d9b48b5d56bfd22cba05109af7)), closes [#29](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/issues/29)
* **ui:** Fixed the bug where the volume input box wasn't cleared after successfully adding a new sound by clicking confirm add. ([7684c1c](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/commit/7684c1c4300c54d969f45a29f9ea44ee849d6069)), closes [#31](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/issues/31)
* **ui:** Fixed the issue where the key sound package selector on the main interface couldn't persist after selecting a sound effect, restarting, or switching interfaces and returning to the main interface, or in other words, this submission avoided the need to reselect the key sound package every time the application is started or switched back to the main interface. Because this submission persisted the user's final choice. ([cb03897](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/commit/cb03897198bcc9aed04109c69a02bd4359e5c3d7)), closes [#54](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/issues/54)
* **ui:** The previous refactoring accidentally introduced fields that shouldn't be stored in the configuration file due to the reference passing issue when passing parameters in JS/TS. This commit fixed this bug. ([49c9055](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/commit/49c90551466df3f2ca65ceff6143a45f083cf879)), closes [#31](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/issues/31) [#33](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/issues/33)
* **ui:** In Vue 3, when a component's setup function returns a Promise, it needs to be wrapped in a <Suspense> component to render correctly. Simply put, you can't use await in the setup function, otherwise, the page won't render correctly. Using lifecycle hooks and using await inside them can solve this. This submission also clarified some lifecycle aspects of this page. ([0e0dd47](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/commit/0e0dd4700c9dbdfef652cf8d3e44535a1becc7fa))

### Features

* Implemented controllable partial startup of single key DIK code and frontend event name mapping. Automatically rejects mapping when multiple keys are pressed and gives a warning; prevents incorrect mapping based on empty character judgment logic (see comments for reasons). ([f67dcb6](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/commit/f67dcb6cabbc2820e435570486086e75653a7ee5)), closes [#47](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/issues/47)
* **sdk | api:** Added a delete function to the kaytonePkg API, in addition to the common get and set, making it more convenient for implementing the delete configuration feature later. ([d331046](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/commit/d33104623a83ad952ab83322fcf3788e870fe2b6))
* **sdk | ui:** Introduced a dedicated SSE in the key sound package module, allowing the UI to obtain the loaded audio file list, making further editing possible [mainly referring to renaming and deleting]. ([22fd6bc](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/commit/22fd6bc9d073230a2bd0007595408ad4baf39c84)), closes [#29](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/issues/29)
* **sdk:** Upgraded the key sound player, adapting audio trimming and graded audio specification with a compatibility-first strategy. ([9e98802](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/commit/9e988029a26f53c82eeb10ec10c07c349c065f61))
* **sdk:** Improved the control of whether to enable embedded test sounds during the key linkage sound step. -> Previously, only the frontend UI code was implemented, and this commit made real adaptations for this feature in the SDK. ([a998cae](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/commit/a998caedd456eefd0fcc5ae1c2aa9d606d829dad)), closes [#43](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/issues/43)
* **sdk:** Performed SHA256 hashing on files before final file saving on the backend, using the hash value as the final file name to save the file. ([58265d0](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/commit/58265d0451003fd5776e364b923b7c6f9d1bda2d)), closes [#23](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/issues/23)
* **sdk:** Supported more audio file formats, such as mp3, ogg, etc. ([6ffce2b](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/commit/6ffce2b65f2decc40a9f6a7680b0211d4128c36a))
* **sse-keyevent:** Mapped key events from the SDK to the frontend, using a map to store keyCode and its corresponding State value. ([5b68e29](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/commit/5b68e29df76cc2c23e16cb2025bd23920f07d8b9))
* **ui | sdk:** Introduced a RESTful API bridge for reading and writing key sound package configuration files. -> This bridge is theoretically universal for new and edit, and the bridge is initialized by the backend at the beginning of "new" or "edit". ([9a482f6](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/commit/9a482f6697636599578ccb3c2d2c0335620ca9ba)), closes [#27](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/issues/27)
* **ui | sdk:** Provided a preview sound button on the new sound creation interface, with a preview playback sound interface provided by the backend for the frontend to implement the preview sound feature. ([125ec42](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/commit/125ec4263b93fcc965f49fd8e9f1ddb108f7720a)), closes [#31](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/issues/31)
* **ui | sdk:** In the SDK, added a volume field to the Cut struct of the second parameter of the sound player, allowing the initialization of the volume of the input sound. Thus, in the UI, the volume parameter can be used when previewing sounds. ([b7cb036](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/commit/b7cb0364e062883563d588662047e6d44b138506)), closes [#31](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/issues/31) [#32](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/issues/32)
* **ui:** Initialized the edit existing sound interface, added a selection input box for selecting existing sounds for further editing. When writing code, pay attention to accurately defining the type of the original model when using this input box, and be cautious with duck typing. ([18b429c](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/commit/18b429cd4192283aad062651b393796a451ffd8e)), closes [#33](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/issues/33)
* **ui:** Implemented the renaming function for editing existing sound source files/managing loaded source files. ([0c3ab18](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/commit/0c3ab184740b18d3638188fe9908c245b4f71268)), closes [#29](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/issues/29)
* **ui:** Initialized the UI interface for creating new sounds. ([bc76369](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/commit/bc76369bd50308ab4291fa15e9cf78f7ce665841)), closes [#31](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/issues/31)
* **ui:** Initialized the editing card after selecting a sound during sound editing. Note that the selection box for source files in the card currently has 1. unable to update in real-time with name changes; 2. only assigns the source type field after selection, with the extra name field still undefined. ([e1ea1b0](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/commit/e1ea1b0caf790f9983c23b6705696c8d9c75a774)), closes [#33](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/issues/33)
* **ui:** Key sound package architecture changes allow selecting three types in key sounds: source file, sound, and key sound. This submission mainly targets the new key sound dialog. Due to breaking changes, editing existing key sounds will not work properly until adapted. ([9e5ffc6](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/commit/9e5ffc65224cbb8efb41758a82e63120d6a92764)), closes [#39](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/issues/39) [#36](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/issues/36)
* **ui:** Key sound packages need a name, and it's required. The name needs an internationalized default value and will be automatically written into the corresponding configuration file. ([e59f87d](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/commit/e59f87da4d2bc1cf9008807de643f18c417f3297)), closes [#28](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/issues/28)
* **ui:** Added three buttons on the editing card after selecting a sound during sound editing: preview sound, confirm modification, and delete sound. ([cef5d53](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/commit/cef5d5304dcd9170dddb2ae8f1d27222b86f78ea)), closes [#33](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/issues/33)
* **ui:** Implemented the function of adding new sounds to the configuration file, added a certain amount of validation logic, and related notification bars. ([d5e835f](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/commit/d5e835f4faf79c81d4cf991c9fda6e247dc9a8ff)), closes [#31](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/issues/31)
* **ui:** Adapted the business logic in the edit existing sound dialog under the new architecture, current adaptation progress -> 1. Adapted the sound selection list for press/release configuration under the new architecture; 2. Encountered an issue, abnormal label display in the list [suspected to be caused by inconsistent key field type paths]. ([ad1a3da](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/commit/ad1a3da6b275ece24ba7bc70cc073a1f14ff83ff)), closes [#37](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/issues/37) [#39](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/issues/39)
* **ui:** Improved the basic usable business logic in the edit existing key sound dialog, but currently, the dialog doesn't support preview buttons and necessary delete buttons, which will be supported gradually later. ([8b8c81a](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/commit/8b8c81a10292961e28834bc114d9cc61906dc645)), closes [#37](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/issues/37)
* **ui:** Improved the basic usable business logic in the new key sound dialog, but currently, the dialog doesn't support preview buttons, which will be supported gradually later. There's also a remaining issue where the list doesn't automatically close after each selection when selecting multiple sounds. ([388fe05](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/commit/388fe05934f747637fa81e6556891ca1aef4f0ac)), closes [#36](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/issues/36)
* **ui:** Provided a key sound package selector on the main interface to allow users to quickly select different key sound packages for use. ([29f9eb2](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/commit/29f9eb28830dee486b9d7a18eb1257d6b3b71632)), closes [#54](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/issues/54)
* **ui:** Added a quick add single key sound button and its dialog page. (Specific functions will be gradually improved -> this submission only initialized the select component for searching/recording single keys on the page -> mainly adapted the initial function of recording single keys) ([78502db](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/commit/78502dbfcca63d4d41f3a3459e46663c74c9b547)), closes [#44](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/issues/44)
* **ui:** Added a real-time mapping function for single DIK code and name, and how the API used by other components can make the code logic clearer. ([51fc510](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/commit/51fc510a688ec464f4b467309bfd76879cd88a3f)), closes [#47](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/issues/47)
* **ui:** Supported the necessary delete button in the edit existing key sound dialog. ([2a06d22](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/commit/2a06d2264fc5053ad4817c593520d0ce65ec3dbd)), closes [#37](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/issues/37)
