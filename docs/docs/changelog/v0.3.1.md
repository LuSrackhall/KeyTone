# `0.3.1` *(2025-01)*

### Bug Fixes

* **sdk:** Verified that even if the key sound package does not exist, it will not cause errors, and the situation where the selected key sound package is an empty string during initialization can actually be classified as such. Therefore, there is no need for the SDK to return an error for an empty string in the RESTful response. ([75d8dce](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/commit/75d8dce448abf175bf124b82ddd865602359a30a)), closes [#56](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/issues/56)
* **ui:** Resolved the issue where the focus remained on the selection component after the user selected a key sound package on the main interface, which could easily lead to accidental touches. ([c45c4bd](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/commit/c45c4bdb7350b0e3812f984fca259f4c22574228)), closes [#56](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/issues/56)
* **ui:** Fixed the issue where the interface would freeze when the key sound package list was empty. ([e2dbf2d](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/commit/e2dbf2d8b2b55ae3493321cafc33968081c6c818)), closes [#56](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/issues/56)
* **ui:** Fixed the issue where the key sound package list did not update to the latest after the user created a new key sound package and returned to the main page. In this commit, the initialization logic of the key sound package list was moved to the App.vue file where it belongs. ([6f94635](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/commit/6f9463557b77f56d249eb2a2797d7bdd60a78959)), closes [#56](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/issues/56)
* **ui:** Provided a quick button on the main interface to clear the selected key sound package, solving the problem where the selected key sound package could not be cleared to the software's initial state after selection.
