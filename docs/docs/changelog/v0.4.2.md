# `0.4.2` *(2025-03)*

### Bug Fixes

* **keytonepkg:** Fixed a bug where after actively clearing the selected keysound package in the main page, the entire application's keysound package usage status did not revert to the default embedded sound. ([afb7371](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/commit/afb73713649423516b13b3bfb2ada8852bbcb6a0)), closes [#65](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/issues/65)
* **volume:** For preview volume operations, they should be based on the original sound of the audio file and should not be affected by global volume settings. This commit fixes this issue. ([1d0dfef](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/commit/1d0dfeffb8291fb6cd0931815bd7a9272b4c9b0c)), closes [#64](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/issues/64)
