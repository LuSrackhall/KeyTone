# `0.3.6` *(2025-01)*

### Bug Fixes

* **electron | ui:** Further fixes for auto-start functionality in the app store version. Changed to include and enable by default during packaging, and guide users in the settings interface to System Settings > Apps > Startup to turn off/on the auto-start feature. ([e03c9a9](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/commit/e03c9a91768fb516025846fcef8d79cadf444f0f))
* **ui:** When volume is 0%, the mute button should remain in off state. ([30c04fb](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/commit/30c04fbb43d20adcb75237dfc12559ba050d3309))
* **ui:** Fixed a bug where the main interface volume slider would automatically revert to its previous position after adjusting via click. (This bug occurred because: For variables requiring real-time persistence, single variable changes are naturally reliable despite communication delays, but multiple variable changes break this property)(Solution: Manually create a delay at the source of secondary variable changes to restore reliability) ([4aa721f](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/commit/4aa721f9a4f2dc916c877f47c77a6af02bc122db))
