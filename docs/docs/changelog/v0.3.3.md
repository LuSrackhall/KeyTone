# `0.3.3` *(2025-01)*

### Bug Fixes

* **electron:** Fixed the issue where startup-related settings were invalid again in Microsoft Store version. ([d100718](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/commit/d100718868938bb29fdff42dfb6ff66e7f33bab2))
* **ui | electron | appx:** Fixed the issue where icon background was white instead of transparent in Windows Store and desktop shortcuts (expected to display with normal transparency as in the image). ([99477f8](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/commit/99477f8e44c7155c9f08b9c6705d022477f166ee)), closes [#57](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/issues/57)
* **ui:** Changed the default behavior of clicking title to enter full page in settings interface - now requires double-click to enter, single-click behavior changed to expand settings same as clicking arrow. ([9f00684](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/commit/9f00684dff011742b4bca32a42c833de27a256d5))
* **ui:** Fixed accidental page entry issue after changing to double-click behavior in settings interface (abandoned default double-click event, switched to single-click event with custom double-click function). ([09d7428](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/commit/09d7428c9da8a0eb9cdf8091688722c1b4f5f3f7))
* **ui:** Fixed incorrect use of volume icon for home-related settings in settings page (although current settings are indeed only volume-related). ([87be226](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/commit/87be2264f955fa1bc79a688629ecd04ee472827c))
