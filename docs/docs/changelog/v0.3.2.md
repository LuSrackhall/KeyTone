# `0.3.2` *(2025-01)*

### Bug Fixes

* **build:** Fixed missing icons when building appx package. In this commit, we used quasar's icongenie icon processing tool's custom configuration to generate the required icon resources in the correct path. ([033eacb](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/commit/033eacbf9d0a4d66f62a9b8f144efebe5c478338)), closes [#57](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/issues/57)
* **electron:** Fixed invalid auto-start related settings in Microsoft Store version ([ac10af0](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/commit/ac10af0962e970ee0789a01f566ba684bafad247))
* **ui | electron | appx:** Attempted to fix icon size and background inconsistency with exe version ([6c6e5f5](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/commit/6c6e5f54e3f2f865339ff96554de51e3f2ea2f2c)), closes [#57](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/issues/57)
* **ui | electron | refactor:** Refactored the logic of boot auto-start related settings. Fixed the issue where app restart was required for settings to take effect (now takes effect immediately after setting). ([b79430c](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/commit/b79430c3b86d00c7a5920f520d64103e5d04396c))
* **ui:** Fixed style anomaly bug caused by line wrapping when route names are too long in top navigation bar. ([c7eae76](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/commit/c7eae76b208de46b9836cfddacd4e5629257dbb3))
