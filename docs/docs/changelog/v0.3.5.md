# `0.3.5` *(2025-01)*

### Bug Fixes

* **electron:** Fixed a bug where enabling the "hide window on startup" setting would cause the sdkIsRun property to not update properly, resulting in tray i18n and other features becoming ineffective. Additionally, the dependency for 'hide window on startup' has been changed to nodejs. ([23f99c6](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/commit/23f99c60f923f671d320706e3d4cc95358deface))
* **electron:** Fixed a bug where after manually toggling and finally enabling the "hide window on startup" setting, the window would still show on second launch (expected behavior is focus only). (The issue was still related to viper's old problem) ([5cc191a](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/commit/5cc191aa509529685880574aeb842ed7e3ce6c69))
* **sse:** Fixed potential SSE connection issues caused by port occupation. ([c2041ac](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/commit/c2041ac10ff3a84a8d31702d1d8626af6db86919))
* **ui | electron | sdk:** Fixed potential issues where UI and node main process RESTful requests in electron couldn't access the actual SDK port due to port occupation (SSE not affected)(except for SPA) ([9b2e705](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/commit/9b2e70533c43ba412047c972e39878b6f347067a))
* **ui | electron:** Fixed a bug where startup and auto-start settings were completely invisible in appx format. ([72ea0f0](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/commit/72ea0f085be0b5cc99dd95d8cf2185dcb932bf5e)), closes [#58](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/issues/58)
* **ui:** Resolved potential resource consumption issues caused by excessive port change monitoring. ([b7f8c6a](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/commit/b7f8c6a0db86365ee103605a12fdc0193213b289))
* **ui:** Fixed a bug where the volume percentage in the main page would change after adjusting the volume increment/decrement amplitude. After fixing, it now remains unchanged (including real-time adjustments, though there's a very small chance of change). ([1100566](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/commit/1100566dfcb2a43c67e2bbbc313898b4b7e48d93))
* **ui:** Fixed a bug related to the previous two fixes where after changing the volume reduction in main page settings and returning to the main page, the volume would change normally. However, when subsequently entering settings to change the volume increment/decrement amplitude and returning to the main page, the percentage abnormally maintained the old percentage from before the reduction-induced change. ([5f4a4fd](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/commit/5f4a4fd503b1e6c09def8f1ac0f803f4b1e79870))
* **ui:** Fixed a bug where sound wouldn't completely disappear when adjusting the volume slider to 0% on the main page. (Added logic to automatically enable mute when volume is 0%) ([df97c32](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/commit/df97c324bd9e8f20149635eac16d664cf6aa05a3))
* **ui:** Fixed a bug caused by the previous fix where the volume percentage in the main page wouldn't change after modifying the volume reduction in main page settings. After fixing, it now changes normally. (This fix doesn't need to include real-time adjustment cases as they weren't affected by this bug) ([9aa1b7e](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/commit/9aa1b7efd53e214c981e25775da3023a2cfa45dd))
* **ui:** Fixed a bug in the main page volume slider where negative percentages would appear when the min absolute value changed from large to small if the selected value (defined as Normal value) was more left than min. (min is affected by the volume reduction in main page settings and original volume increment/decrement settings) ([f852da1](https://github.com/LuSrackhall/KeyTone/commit/f852da1c0e2f1643e0ec82e31e76dcf1a2d353cb))
